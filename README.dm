METRIC & AquaCrop Workflow for Hyper-Arid Olive Orchards (Tacna, Peru)
Reproducible Evapotranspiration Modeling for High-Yield (2021–2022) and Water-Limited (2023–2024) Seasons

Overview

This repository contains the complete workflow used to estimate actual evapotranspiration (ETa) in a hyper-arid olive orchard located in La Yarada–Los Palos, Tacna, Peru, integrating:

METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration) implemented in Google Earth Engine (GEE).

AquaCrop (FAO), calibrated for two contrasting olive-growing seasons.

PlanetScope-based Random Forest canopy cover classification.

Irrigation, meteorological, and soil datasets needed to replicate the results.

This project adapts and extends the repository: https://github.com/vilcagamarracf/Inv_arroz_METRIC

to develop a METRIC workflow tailored for perennial woody crops (olive) under hyper-arid environment conditions.

The code, parameterization, and data structure allow full reproducibility of the study:
